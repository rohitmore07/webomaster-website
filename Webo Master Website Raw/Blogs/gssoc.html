<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "6"><b>What does Open-source mean?</b></font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4">The term "open source" refers to computer software or applications.  This computer software that is developed as a public and also made freely available to the public.</br>The term Open-source is closely related to Open-source software (OSS). This phrase indicates that a product gives permission to use its content, design documents, or source code.</font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "6"><b>What is open source software (OSS) development?</b></font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4">Open source development is a way of creating software where the source code - which is the set of instructions that tell a computer what to do - is made publicly available for anyone to view, use, and modify.</font></p>
<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4"><i><b>Some examples of OSS:</b></i></font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4">- Mozilla Firefox
</br>- jQuery
<br>- GNU/Linux
</br>- VLC media player, etc.</font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4">Open-source development allows a community of developers to work together to create software that is free to use and modify.</br>This community can collaborate on the code, suggest improvements, and fix bugs. Some open source solutions are very popular and are even market leaders (e.g., Linux, Apache).</br>

Hence, throughout SSOC/GSSOC programs, participants contribute to different projects under guidance of experienced mentors.</font></p>


<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "6"><b>Benefits of open source software (OSS):</b></font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4"><b>1. High quality -</b></br> Most open source software is of high quality. Open source software can also be efficiently used in coding.</br>

<b>2. Better Flexibility -</b></br> Greater flexibility is available with open-source software. This is adaptable in that it enables programmers to examine the code's functionality and make adjustments as necessary.</br>

<b>3. Cost-Effectiveness -</b></br> Although open source solutions offer more than just free software, the fact that they require no or low licencing costs remains a key benefit when installing a low-cost solution.</br>

<b>4. Speed -</b></br> Open source software enables developers to bring valuable business applications to market faster.</font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "6"><b>What are these?</b></font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4">SSOC (Social Summer of Code) and GSSOC (GirlScript Summer of Code) are Open Source programs which take place during summer. 
Their aim is to help beginners get started with Open Source Development. It is a fantastic initiative and chance for students to discover how open source development genuinely works.</font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "6"><b>Why should you participate in SSOC/GSSOC?</b></font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4">Contributing to open source has countless advantages. It provides us a chance to tackle problems in the real world, it teaches us about teamwork, and it helps us develop our coding skills. You get to choose what you want to work on while being a part of a diverse community that is willing to assist you!</font></p>
<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4"><i><b>Example for SSOC 2023 projects:

</b></i></font></p>

<p class="w3-center w3-large"><font face = "WildWest" size = "4">In the Face-X project, there are different machine learning algorithms for facial recognition. You can go through issues listed in the project such as improve documentation, frontend improvement, add AR/VR, Temperature prediction etc. This could be a good project if you're someone who knows python and ML/AI. Also, as the issues are also about frontend, UI/UX even web Developers, and designers can contribute to this project.</font></p>
